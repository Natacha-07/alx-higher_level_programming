# alx-higher_level_programming

Started learning python on ALX.
Concepts

For this project, we are expected you to look at this concept:

Author’s disclaimerWelcome to the Python world! The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple! If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come. You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations. Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. Enjoy! - Guillaume Resources

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

GeneralWhy Python programming is awesomeWho created PythonWho is Guido van RossumWhere does the name ‘Python’ come fromWhat is the Zen of PythonHow to use the Python interpreterHow to print text and variables using printHow to use stringsWhat are indexing and slicing in PythonWhat is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

RequirementsPython ScriptsAllowed editors: vi, vim, emacsAll your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)All your files should end with a new lineThe first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repositoryA README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatoryYour code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)All your files must be executableThe length of your files will be tested using wcShell ScriptsAllowed editors: vi, vim, emacsAll your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTSAll your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)All your files should end with a new lineThe first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bashAll your files must be executableC ScriptsAllowed editors: vi, vim, emacsAll your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89All your files should end with a new lineYour code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.plYou are not allowed to use global variablesNo more than 5 functions per fileIn the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examplesThe prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.hDon’t forget to push your header fileAll your header files should be include guardedMore InfoZenThe Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! Pycodestyle

Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code
